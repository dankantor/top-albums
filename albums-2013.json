Their debut album blew me away and every time I go back to it I love it even more. The last 3 mins of the album are absolutely sublime. Eagerly looking forward to seeing these guys live and their next album."

After listening to it a few dozen times, I started to realize the album had a theme - suicide. I asked them about it on Facebook and they confirmed. Whether it's depressing or not, it's damn enjoyable to listen to."

Then again in 2011 when 'Bloodless Coup' was my #4. They have a few albums prior to that and they are all great too. This one is a little more subdued then the previous ones but still hits home for me."

They came in again at #8 with 'Reptillians' in 2011 although it hasn't held up for me well since then. I was hoping they would reverse the trend and release a better album, and they sure did this year. It's on the longer side with 15 songs but each one is great."

Then a few years ago, I liked their album but not enough to put it on my top list. I went in to this album with moderate expectations and they were easily beat. This album is so good from top to bottom. For some reason they remind me of Simon and Garfunkel, which is probably one of the highest honors you could bestow upon a band."

After I got that sorted out, I found this album and already loved 2 songs from it. The other 6 are just as good. It's surfer pop which is usually a genre I get tired of quickly. But not this album. It's short and sweet and enjoyable every time."

I was surprised they came out with a new album this year but just like last year, it's very well done. Each song has a hook with some serious auto-tune that gets me every time."
